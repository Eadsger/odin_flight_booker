# Flight Booker

Flight Booker is a Ruby on Rails application that simulates a one-way flight booking system. It allows users to search for available flights, select a flight, enter passenger information, and provide billing details for booking confirmation. This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where we explore advanced forms and user interactions in Rails.

## Features

- Search for available flights based on desired dates and airports.
- Select from a list of available flights.
- Enter passenger information for all passengers.
- Enter billing information for booking confirmation.
